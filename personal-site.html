        [I would want to write something like this: Hello there! Im David Yemoh and this is my website. This website is my own creative outlet for people who are interested in (or looking to hire) me can visit and get to know me a lot better. So to begin, I come from Ghana in the western part of Africa. I grew with two siblings in a  family of five, in the southern part of Ghana, in Accra which is also the capital city of the country. Accra is always busy, and with a Mom that is a trader, I always thought I was going to go into trade but as I grew up, other things started to interest me…..]

      <h3>[Work Background]</h3>
      <p>
        [With the working background page, I would like to talk about my professional background and what I aim to do going forward. It would look something like this: I left home for to a different region for school. In school I had a teacher who was keen on recruiting some kids for a project he was working on. It was during this time I developed a passion for computers. after school I came back home to find my brother also involved with computers. we worked together for a time fixing computers and helping resolve operation system problems. The basic stuff. After serving a mission for my church, I had an opportunity to get a degree in Computer Information Technology. I aim to continue working to improve upon myself, and as a career, continue to work with computers in the networking field.  ]

      <h3>[Interest and Hobbies]</h3>
      <p>
        [In the interest and hobbies field, I will talk about things that interest me outside of the work field that also, at the same time helps tell more of my story. I would be something like this: Growing up I played soccer and table tennis. Apart from sports I have also a strong interest in moviemaking, I really like the science, painstaking detail, and creativity that goes into making films. Because of this interest I’m currently looking into taking some classes on campus to be more acquainted with the process of movie making, and with how much technology goes into filmmaking nowadays, I’m interested to know what my role could be in making movies one day. Apart from movies and sports I have recently taken up photography to explore more of my creativity. Afterall technology nowadays is a combination between science and creativity. ]
