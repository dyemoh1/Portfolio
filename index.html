    <h2> Hello there! Im David Yemoh.
        and this is my website. This website is my own creative outlet for people who are interested in (or looking to hire) 
        me can visit and get to know me a lot better. So to begin, I come from Ghana in the western part of Africa. 
        I grew with two siblings in a family of five,
        in the southern part of Ghana, in Accra 
        which is also the capital city of the country. Accra is always busy, and with a Mom that is a trader, I always thought
         I was going to go into trade but as I grew up, other thing
         s started to interest meâ€¦..</h2>
