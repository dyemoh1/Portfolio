            <h2>     
              Growing up I played soccer and table tennis.
               Apart from sports I have also a strong interest in moviemaking, I really like the science, painstaking detail,
                and creativity that goes into making films. 
               Because of this interest I'm currently looking into taking some classes on campus to be more acquainted with the process of movie making, 
               and with how much technology goes into filmmaking nowadays,
                I'm  really interested to know what my role could be in making movies one day.
                 Apart from movies and sports I have recently taken up photography to explore more of my creativity.
                  Afterall technology nowadays is a combination between science and creativity.
