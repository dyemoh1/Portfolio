         I left home for to a different region for school. In school I had a teacher who was keen on recruiting some kids for a project he was working on.
          It was during this time I developed a passion for computers. 
          After school I came back home to find my brother also involved with computers.
           we worked together for a time fixing computers and helping resolve operation system problems. The basic stuff.
            After serving a mission for my church, I had an opportunity to get a degree in Computer Information Technology.
             I aim to continue working to improve upon myself, and as a career, continue to work with computers in the networking field.
